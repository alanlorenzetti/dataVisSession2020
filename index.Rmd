# Introduction

In this session we will cover a few topics on data visualization.

**1.** We are going to reproduce a protein-protein interaction network I've made for a paper published recently. For that, we are going to use Cytoscape.

**2.** We will explore different types of variables and plot them using the R language environment. More specifically we will use RStudio Cloud and a package called `ggplot2`.

# Network visualization using Cytoscape

## Context

In deLomana et al. [2020], we studied the aspects of the translational regulation of _Halobacterium salinarum_. One of the questions we needed to answer to support one of our hypothesis was:

* Is transcription and translation coupled in _H. salinarum_?

We know that transcription and translation happen in different compartments in the eukaryotic cell: Transcription happens inside the nuclei. Translation happens in the cytoplasm.

In the prokaryotic cell, we don't have a membrane to separate the genetic material from the cytoplasm, so transcription and translation are likely to happen simultaneously. Coupled transcription and translation is a fact in Bacteria. But what about Archaea?

```{r transcriptionTranslation, out.width = "800px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/transcription_translation.jpg")
```

In the Baliga Lab, a few years ago, Mark Facciotti and his colleagues performed a target coimmunoprecipitation experiment to find out what were the proteins coupled to specific proteins of the transcription machinery, the general transcription factors of _H. salinarum_. [Facciotti et al. 2007].

Using those results, we checked if proteins of the translational machinery were present in the pulldown fractions of transcription proteins. Indeed, we were able to find a few, supporting our hypothesis of coupled transcription and translation:

```{r ppiFig, out.width = "500px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ppiFig.jpg")
```

RPs physically interact with transcription complex components. Diamonds represent RPs; squares represent transcription complex components. Tagged proteins used as bait in the immunoprecipitation experiment are highlighted by a black border. Arrowheads link bait to coimmunoprecipitated proteins. We labeled each of the seven modules obtained by the Newman-Girvan clustering algorithm using a different color [de Lomana et al., 2020].

## Data structure

### Protein-protein interaction network

This is the structure of a Simple Interaction File (SIF) 

```{r ppiData, echo = F}
datatable(ppi)
```

### Protein information

```{r proteinInfo, echo = F}
datatable(ppiFunCat)
```

## Installing Cytoscape and apps (or plugins)

**1.** Go to the Cytoscape [download page](https://cytoscape.org/download.html). Download and install it.  

**2.** Open Cytoscape program and install the following apps:  

  + clusterMaker2  
  `Apps -> App Manager -> Search: clusterMaker2 -> Select listing -> Click on Install button`  
  + Color Cast  
  `Apps -> App Manager -> Search: Color Cast -> Select listing -> Click on Install button`  
  + yFiles Layout Algorithms  
  `Apps -> App Manager -> Search: yFiles -> Select listing -> Click on Install button`  

## Plotting a protein-protein interaction network

**1.** Import the protein-protein interaction file `ppi.sif`.  
`File -> Import -> Network from URL ->`  
`https://alanlorenzetti.github.io/dataVisSession2020/data/ppi.sif`

**2.** Import the protein information table.  
`File -> Import -> Table from URL ->` 
`https://alanlorenzetti.github.io/dataVisSession2020/data/ppiFunCat.tsv ->`  
`Where to Import Table Data: To selected networks only -> Click on OK button`

**3.** Click on `Style` tab. Let's change the design of our network.

  + Select the `Sample1` preset style.
  + Change the label of nodes by selecting the `label` column.
  + Change the shape of nodes according to the functional `class` of proteins. Rectangles will represent `Transcription` class. Diamonds will represent `Translation` class.
  + Add a thick border to the nodes of proteins used as baits. Set size `2`.
  + Make the nodes bigger. Select size `35`.
  + Click on the `Edge` tab. Make the edges thicker (size `1.5`) and `black`.
  + Add arrowheads (`Target Arrow Shape; Delta`) to the end of edges.
  + Remove edge labels.
  
**4.** Apply the Newman-Girvan modularity algorithm to find modules of highly interconnected proteins. Use the default parameters.
`Apps -> clusterMaker -> Community Cluster (GLay)`

**5.** Change the color of nodes according to the modules. We will use a plugin called `Color Cast` to make our lives easier. Select `__glayCluster` as the target data column. We'll apply the `Set2` colors.
`Tools -> Color Cast -> Color Cast`

**6.** Remove all the nodes not classified as `Transcription` or `Translation`.

  + Using the `Node Table` panel, order the class column and select all proteins of those classes.
  + Then right-click the selection and then click on `Select nodes from selected rows`.
  + Hide the unselected nodes. `Select -> Nodes -> Hide Unselected Nodes`.
  
**7.** Apply an automatic layout.

  + Select all proteins used as baits (those with borders).
  + Apply `yFiles Hierarchic Layout Selected Nodes`. `Layouts -> Hierarchic Layout Selected Nodes`.
  
**8.** Save your network and export as an image file.

  + `File -> Save`
  + `File -> Export -> Network to Image`

# Data visualization in R using the `ggplot2` package

## Installing `ggplot2` package

```{r install, eval=F}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

## Loading libs and the table we will work with

```{r loadLibs}
# loading ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())

# loading our dataframe
haloExp = read.delim("https://alanlorenzetti.github.io/dataVisSession2020/data/haloExpression.tsv")
```

## Variable types

### Discrete variables

* Counts:  

  + The number of times you cursed this damn virus this week (5)
  + Number of stars in the Milky Way (250 billion or 2.5 x 10^11)
  + Number of genes in a genome (2600)
  + Number of messenger RNA molecules in a bacterial cell (~1800) [Moran et al. 2013]
  + Length of a messenger RNA (1573 nucleotides)

### Continuous variables

* Measures:

  + Height of an individual (162.56 centimeters) 
  + Weight of an individual (89.77 kilograms)
  + mRNA expression (1401.75 arbitrary expression unit)
  + protein expression (1500.62 arbitrary expression unit)

* Ratios:  

  + GC content, i.e., frequency of Guanine or Cytosine bases in a transcript (e.g. 973/1573 = 0.619)
  

### Categorical variables

* Characteristics:  
  + Color of eyes (black, brown, blue, green, red)
  + Biological process of a protein (Transcription, Cell Motility, Function unknown, etc).
